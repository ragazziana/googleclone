# Cloning Google Project

This is an assignment for The Odin Project of the Web Development track. 
The main goal was to build the Google.com homepage, only the simple one with a search box and menus.

For this project, I used mostly flexbox for position elements on the navbar, main, and footer.

Had a hard time trying to position the icons on the search box. In the end, I managed to put all of them using the "position: absolute" and working with margins and paddings.
